            <p> <b>Narrated Qais bin Kathir:</b></p>
            <p>“A man from Al-Madinah came to Abu Ad-Darda when he was in Dimashq. He replied: ‘A Hadith reached me
                which you have
                narrated from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).’ He said: ‘You did not come for some need?’ He said: ‘No.’ He
                said: ‘Did you
                come for trade?’ He said: ‘No, I did not come except seeking this Hadith.’ So he said: ‘Indeed, I heard
                the Messenger of
                Allah (ﷺ) saying: “Who takes a path upon which he seeks knowledge, then Allah makes a path to Paradise
                easy for him. And
                indeed the angels lower their wings in approval to the one seeking knowledge. Indeed forgiveness isought
                for the
                knowledgeable one by whomever is in the heavens and whomever is in the earth, even the fish in the
                waters. And the
                superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like the superiority of the moon over the rest of the
                celestial bodies.
                Indeed the scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, and the Prophets do not leave behind Dinar or Dirham.
                The only legacy
                of the scholars is knowledge, so whoever takes from it, then he has indeed taken the most able share.
